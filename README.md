## About
The San Andreas Police Department (SAPD) Roleplay System is a front-end web dashboard built for roleplay administration and management. This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets to run a polished, responsive administrative dashboard for in-game police roleplay servers. The site is intended for demonstration, documentation, and administration of roleplay systems — not real-world law enforcement.

This project is community-driven and aims to deliver a clean user interface for managing penal codes, rosters, case files, patrol logs and other core police roleplay workflows.
